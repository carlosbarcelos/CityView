# CityView: Urban Data Visualization
Two students created a system for urban data visualization titled CityView. CityView provides data visualization for large datasets of spatial-temporal data points. 

## Abstract
The goal of this project is to create a website that would give users the power to analyze datasets of varying spatial-temporal categorization while providing them with real-world scenarios in which this system could be used for urban development.  We accomplished this goal through data visualizations, tools, and data stories all displayed to the user in a clear and informative manner. We believe that CityView is acustomizable system which can be successfully expanded upon and we suggest future directions in which to make that expansion.

## Features
### Static Data Visualization
The [Static Data Visualization](CityView/datasets/staticData.html) page a robust toggling feature. Users can select which datasets they want to visualize to get a customizable view at their data while selecting the map type as an additional accessibility option. This allows the user to find effective and efficient new locations for bike share hubs around the city of Boston.

### Time Series Data Visualization
The [Time Series Data Visualization](CityView/datasets/timeSeriesData.html) page provides a smiliar layer toggling like the Static Data Visualization. In addition to this, the Time Series Data Visualization also makes use of Leafletâ€™s customizability by introducing the carousel feature. This visualization can help to optimize recycling collection routes. The dataset we used shows daily trends but could easily be outfitted with hourly, monthly, or yearly datasets to discover other data trends.

### Dynamic Data Visualization
The [Dynamic Data Visualization](CityView/datasets/dynamicData.html) page provides an moving image of the data that is presents. It uses many tools that CARTO provides. The resultant visualization can give taxi companies in New York City a foundation of knowledge about their pickup and dropoff data to negotiate better policies for both the company and the taxi drivers. 

### Learn More About The Data
The [Data information](CityView/dataInformation.html) page provides more information on the type of data and actual data sets that are used throughout this project. It provides details and even specific data stories to inspire the use cases that this project presents.
