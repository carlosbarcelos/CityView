            Urban data can be categorized into three combinations of spatial-temporal data.
            These pairs are generally defined by a geographical location and a datetime.

        More specifically, <em>spatial-temporal</em> can be broken down into its two parts.
        Spatial refers to the location of the data point, generally defined by an ordered pair: (latitude, longitude).
        Temporal refers to the time at which the data point was collected, often in the form: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the purposes of these visualizations, please refer to the following terminology: <br>
        Spatially-Static and Temporally-Static Data &rarr; Static Data <br>
        Spatially-Static and Temporally-Dynamic Data &rarr; Time Series Data <br>
        Spatially-Dynamic and Temporally-Dynamic Data &rarr; Dynamic Data <br><br>

        Please note that datasets with the combination of spatially-dynamic and temporally-static are impossible to collect, as this type of data implies instantaneous change, which is not feasible for physical data sets. <br><br>

            <h3>Contour Lines | Streetlights | Hubway Stations</h3>
            <p>
              Imagine a bike share program interested in creating new locations for their existing bike share network.
              In this example, consider the city wide Hubway Bike Share in Boston, MA.
              Using just three datasets and our mapping features, we are able to give recommendations on where and where not to place new Hubway bike stations.
            </p>

                <p>
                  First consider the safety of a bike rider - new bike stations should be placed in a well-lit areas.
                  Using a data set of all street lights in Boston, we are able to cross-reference areas that are more or less safe for new bike rental stations.

                  Using this view gives a high level view of the city. For a more useful application we could use this view to ask
                  “Is this area a well-lit location for a new bike station?” For example, there are not any street lights in the
                  neighborhood of Round Hill or Edge Hill street. The bike share manager may have thought this would be a successful
                  location due to the high population of the residential area, however our urban data visualization shows that putting
                  a bike station in that area may lead to decreased rider safety and increased bike theft under the veil of a dark night.

            <h4>On Contour Lines</h4>
            <p>
              Next consider the users that will have to ride the bikes in their physical environment.
              One common problem that bike share programs have is that users will avoid areas with steep hills.
              By adding a contour layer we are able to get an idea about the environment and make decisions based on the elevation of the land.
            </p>

              <div class="col-8">
                <p>
                  For example, consider adding a new bike station at New England Baptist Hospital. The bike share manager may initially
                  think that a hospital would be a popular place for a new bike station; the hospital may promote healthy transportation
                  and there are a lot of employees who might benefit from riding a bike to work. However, when considering the terrain,
                  it is clear that New England Baptist Hospital is on a steep hill due to the frequent and closely packed contour lines.
                  Using the contour data it the bike share manager realizes that the hospital is on too steep of a hill to make it a successful bike station.

              <div class="col-8">
                <p>
                  All of this data is useful individually but more powerful all together. By combining the three layers of data on one map
                  we are able to show a more complete picture of the urban environment. Now the user can find the best location a new bike station,
                  considering well lit areas and low elevations. Furthermore, they can ensure that the locations of bike stations are
                  neither to close together - causing redundant stops - nor too far apart - causing long uncomfortable rides - from one another.

                Imaging a recycling company interested in understanding how their teams move throughout the city during the week.
                The company can use GPS locations to track each of the houses that their trucks visit during each day of the week.
                Using this data, they would be able to visualize the the time series distribution of their resources on our website.
                In our example, we used existing recycling data recorded during each weekday. Five unique colors differentiate
                each day of the week. Within each day, each data point shows a location that was visited by the recycling company.
              </p>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-8">
              <p>
                The recycling company can use this visualization to make some important discoveries. For example, imagine the company
                invests in a new truck and needs to consider which area to send that truck. They can use our system to view
                each day’s data one at a time in order to find the area in the city that has the most stops with relatively few trucks
                visiting those stops. By doing this sort of analysis, the recycling company is able to better distribute their trucks in order to maximize coverage in the city.

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            Furthermore, using our visualizations the recycling company is able to determine the best route for their trucks
            on any given day. Assuming that the company has a large fleet of trucks, the best option they have is to spread out
            their trucks throughout the city and have those trucks service large neighborhoods in one day of operation.
            By separating the trucks, the company is able to minimize the amount of traffic that they cause in the city.
            By servicing entire neighborhoods at a time, the company is able to alleviate the burden on a neighborhood by visiting the area only once.
          </p>

            <div class="col-8">
              <p>
                Using our visualization tools we are able to see one area in which this best practice is violated.
                Using the data from the Wednesday (purple) and Friday (red) datasets, we are able to see a situation in which
                the recycling company a) crosses the large Arborway highway unnecessarily because they b) fail to service the
                entire neighborhood on the east side of Washington Street. By simply visualizing this data we can recommend to
                the recycling company that they should consider servicing the Washington Street neighborhood entirely on Friday
                in order to both optimize their coverage in that area and alleviate any traffic congestion they may cause.

            Our visualization tools also offer a “carousel” feature which separates the visualization for each day of the week
            and shows the days, one by on, for a short period of time. This feature allows the user to find patterns as their time series data evolves over time.

<h1>On Spatial-Temporal Datasets</h1>
<p>Urban data can be categorized into three combinations of spatial-temporal
data. Spatial refers to the location of the data point, generally defined
by an ordered pair: (latitude, longitude). Temporal refers to the time at
which the data point was collected, often in the form: <em>yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss</em>
</p>
<p>
For the purposes of these visualizations, please refer to the following terminology:
</br>
&emsp; Spatially-Static and Temporally-Static Data <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Static Data
</br>
&emsp; Spatially-Static and Temporally-Dynamic Data <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Time Series Data
</br>
&emsp; Spatially-Dynamic and Temporally-Dynamic Data <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Dynamic Data
</p>
<p>Please note that datasets with the combination of spatially-dynamic and
temporally-static are impossible to collect, as this type of data implies
instantaneous change, which is not feasible for physical data sets.
</p>
<p>These are the data sets we used and information about them.</p>

<h1>Static Data
<a href="datasets/spatial-static_temporal-static.html"><i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
</h1>
<p>This type of data refers to fixed points in space. When applied to a map they
reveal information about geographical distribution of some dataset. It can be
described as both spatially-static and temporally-static.
</p>
<p>These are the static data sets we used and some information describing the datasets.</p>

<h1>Time Series Data
<a href="datasets/spatial-static_temporal-dynamic.html"><i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
</h1>
<p>This type of data shows the change in a particular location over time. This
can refer to the change of a number of catagories of data, often relating to
the collection or redistribution of some entity at a location. It can be
described as spatially-static and temporally-dynamic.

<h1>Dynamic Data
<a href="datasets/spatial-dynamic_temporal-dynamic.html"><i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
</h1>
<p>This type of data shows how an object moves over time. By linking together
many datapoints for a single object with unique time and location values, it
possible to view change over time. The most appropraite analogy for this behavior
is how an object travels. It can be described as both spatially-dyanamic and temporally-dyanamic.</p>
<p>These are the dynamic data sets we used and some information describing the datasets.</p>
