  <h1>On Spatial Temporal Datasets</h1>
  <p>Urban data can be catagorized by three combinations of spatial-temporal
    data. Spatial refering to the location of the data point, generally defined
    by an ordered pair: (latitude, longitude). Temporal refering to the time
    which the data point was collected, often in the form: <em>yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss</em>
  </p>
  <p>[Image of the combination table of spatial-temporal]</p>
  <p>Please note, that the datasets whose combination is spatially dynamic and
    temporally static is impossible to collect as this type of data implies
    instantaneous change which is not feasible for physical data sets.
  </p>
  <p>These are the data sets we used and information about them.</p>

  <h1>Spatially Static and Temporally Static</h1>
  <p>This type of data refer to fixed points in space. When applied to a map they
    reveal information about geographical distribution of some dataset.
  </p>
  <p>These are the spatially statics and temporally static data sets we used and information about them.</p>

  <h1>Spatially Static and Temporally Dynamic</h1>
  <p>This type of data shows the change in a particular location over time. This
   can refer to the change of a number of catagories of data, often relating to
   the collection or redistribution of some entity at a location.
  </p>
  <p>These are the spatially static and temporally dynamic data sets we used and information about them.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dataset 1</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Explination 1</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Dataset 2</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Explination 2</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <h1>Spatially Dynamic and Temporally Dynamic</h1>
  <p>This type of data shows how an object moves over time. By linking together
      many datapoints for a single object with unique time and location values, it
    possible to view change over time. The most appropraite analogy for this behavior
  is how an object travels.</p>
  <p>These are the spatially dynamic and temporally dynamic data sets we used and information about them.</p>
